title: Welcome to 4th NDN Hackathon
---

The NDN Team is organizing our 4th NDN Hackathon on March 25 and 26, 2017 on the University of Memphis Campus in Memphis, TN.  We solicit Hackathon project proposals that advance the state of NDN.  Participants will have approximately **12 hours** to work on the projects.

We encourage projects that:

 - directly address NDN research needs,
 - create new NDN tools or modify existing tools,
 - create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
